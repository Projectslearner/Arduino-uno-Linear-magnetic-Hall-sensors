# Arduino-uno-Linear-magnetic-Hall-sensors
The Arduino Uno Linear Magnetic Hall Sensors detect changes in magnetic field strength along a linear axis. They typically utilize the Hall effect to produce a voltage proportional to the magnetic field intensity, enabling applications such as position sensing, proximity detection, and speed measurement in linear motion systems.
